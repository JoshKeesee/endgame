                <p class="pb-4">Hello! My presentation is on this movie: Avengers - Endgame.</p>
                <hr>
                <h1 class="text-xl underline pt-4">So, what is this movie about?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>This movie is about a super hero group called the Avengers that has to go back in time to save their fellow super heros from the enemy Thanos, who thinks that he should be the leader of the whole universe and that everything should go his way and that everyone should obey him.</p>
            </a>
            <a id="2" onclick="big(this.id)" class="select-none transition-all cursor-pointer content inline-block m-2 border-gray-400 border-2 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-black shadow-md min-h-xl">
                <h1 class="text-xl underline">Now, what Rhetorical Terms does this movie have?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Some of the rhetorical terms that this movie has and that I will be covering are theme, mood, imagery, narrative, personification, repetition, point of view, symbolism, figurative language, and lastly allusion.</p>
            </a>
            <a id="3" onclick="big(this.id)" class="select-none transition-all cursor-pointer content inline-block m-2 border-gray-400 border-2 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-black shadow-md min-h-xl">
                <h1 class="text-xl underline">What is Theme?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Well, for starters, theme is not <span class="cursor-pointer" onclick="toggleTheme()">This</spa>. What theme actually is is the main or central idea of the story. The main idea of Endgame is that the Avengers need to save half of the universe from disappearing into thin air. They need to do this by making a time machine and then going back in time to get the 6 infinity stones to snap them back into existence.</p>
            </a>
            <a id="4" onclick="big(this.id)" class="select-none transition-all cursor-pointer content inline-block m-2 border-gray-400 border-2 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-black shadow-md min-h-xl">
                <h1 class="text-xl underline">Second, what is a Mood?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Mood is the emotional feeling that the story creates. For example, the movie Endgame has many moods. One of them is at the very end where (SPOILER ALERT) 2 of the avengers die. This effect can be created by music, words, or even by what is going on in the story itself.</p>
            </a>
            <a id="5" onclick="big(this.id)" class="select-none transition-all cursor-pointer content inline-block m-2 border-gray-400 border-2 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-black shadow-md min-h-xl">
                <h1 class="text-xl underline">Third, what is Imagery?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Imagery is the image that is painted in your head. For movies, imagery is simple. Just place a few pictures or videos on screen and BOOM! Imagery. For books and stories however, imagery is a little bit harder. Books use lots of different discriptive words to paint the image in your head. Some of the words could be "daunted", or "gleeful", or "dazzling" etc.</p>

            <a id="6" onclick="big(this.id)" class="select-none transition-all cursor-pointer content inline-block m-2 border-gray-400 border-2 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-black shadow-md min-h-xl">
                <h1 class="text-xl underline">Fourth, what is a Narrative?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>A narrative is simply a book or story. Like Endgame or Dr. Seuss's books.</p>
            </a>
            <a id="7" onclick="big(this.id)" class="select-none transition-all cursor-pointer content inline-block m-2 border-gray-400 border-2 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-black shadow-md min-h-xl">
                <h1 class="text-xl underline">Well that was easy. How about Personification?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>There are lots of ways to describe personification. For example, a walking, talking tree named Groot, or talking animals that can be found in stories. Personification doesn't have to always be inatimate objects that can walk and talk, but it can also be that those objects are described to have human-like features to them.</p>
            </a>
            <a id="8" onclick="big(this.id)" class="select-none transition-all cursor-pointer content inline-block m-2 border-gray-400 border-2 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-black shadow-md min-h-xl">
                <h1 class="text-xl underline">Ok, how about Rererererepetition?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>This one is kind of self-explanitory. Repetition is just where certain events repeat themselves, like in Endgame where the same Thanos from 2 different time zones has to fight the avengers.</p>
            </a>
            <a id="9" onclick="big(this.id)" class="select-none transition-all cursor-pointer content inline-block m-2 border-gray-400 border-2 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-black shadow-md min-h-xl">
                <h1 class="text-xl underline">Seventh, what is a Point-of-View?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>A point of view is the story from a certain character's "glasses". For example, in the beginning of Endgame, Captain America and Iron Man have 2 opposite views on if they should build a time machine or not. Captain America thinks that they should try to get back all of their teamates, while Iron Man is perfectly content where he is with his family.</p>
            </a>
            <a id="10" onclick="big(this.id)" class="select-none transition-all cursor-pointer content inline-block m-2 border-gray-400 border-2 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-black shadow-md min-h-xl">
                <h1 class="text-xl underline">Eighth, what is Symbolism?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Symbolism is the idea that something represents something else. An example of this would be a Paradigm Shift. A paradigm shift is a different way of looking at something, even though it doesn't sound like it.</p>
            </a>
            <a id="11" onclick="big(this.id)" class="select-none transition-all cursor-pointer content inline-block m-2 border-gray-400 border-2 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-black shadow-md min-h-xl">
                <h1 class="text-xl underline">Ninth, what is Figurative Language?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Figurative language is language that is figurative. It's not literal. For example, "You look like a sunflower today!" is a simile, which is part of figurative language. Figurative language has many attributes to it. Some of those attributes are Simile's, Metaphor's, Onomateopetia, Personification, Irony, Alliteration, and more!</p>
            </a>
            <a id="12" onclick="big(this.id)" class="select-none transition-all cursor-pointer content inline-block m-2 border-gray-400 border-2 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-black shadow-md min-h-xl">
                <h1 class="text-xl underline">And lastly, what is an Allusion?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>An allusion is a phrase or word that references something different. For example, dogs in France may know what "Le Woof" means, while dogs in America are just like, "Dawg, you got a problem". Seriously. Another example is in Endgame where the avengers are arguing about how time travel works and the term "Back to the Future" is brought up.</p>
